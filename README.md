# JavaProducts
a java program to simulate sales from a store.
to execute my program, the user must get the Salesman file from the git, and then execute on a java IDE, or alternately, the user should  open his OsShell, the cmd on widows or the prompt on Linux, and input Javac "user directory to his Salesman file"/Salesman
and then input Java Salesman, and it shoud run. On a IDE, just open the Salesman file and run.
